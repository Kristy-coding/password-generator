# Password-Generator

### Description
For this project we were given starter code in the form of HTML and CSS. We were then instructed to write JavaScript
logic to make the project a functioning, interactive password generator. When the user clicks the generate password 
button, they are presented with a series of prompts to select password criteria. Once the password criteria is selected
a password will be generated and displayed in the text box.
